# ddc-homepage

# quick summary

ddc stands for daydream.computer; a friendly programming-enthusiast community
that wants to share our experiences in a community-created zine.

# goals

we hope to create a zine that discusses our journeys, discoveries, and
excitement within our exploration of programming and our personal projects.

# reasoning

as enthusiasts, we love talking about our own, and hearing other's experiences
with programming.

# the lowercase, tilde.town, and our values

inconsistent lowercase is great because it's easier to type in the terminal,
and it's more accessible to people whose main focus isn't english punctuation
and grammar.

lowercase is also the unwritten spirit of [tilde.town](https://tilde.town/)
where we all met. tilde.town is built around the foundations of kindness,
respect, intentional community, and inclusiveness. these are values we wish to
see not only in our community, but also on the internet as a whole.
