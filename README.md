# us

we are a friendly programming-enthusiast community that wants to share our
discoveries, experiences, and ideas in a community-created zine.

# goals

we hope to create a zine that discusses our journeys, discoveries, and
excitement within our exploration of programming and our personal projects.

# reasoning

as enthusiasts, we love talking about our own, and hearing other people's
experiences with programming.

# our values


tilde.town is built around kindness, respect, intentional community, and
inclusiveness. these are values we wish to see not only in our community, but
also on the internet as a whole.
