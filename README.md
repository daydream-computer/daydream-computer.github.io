# us

we are a friendly programming-enthusiast community that wants to share our
discoveries, experiences, and ideas in a community-created zine.

# goals

we hope to create a zine that discusses our journeys, discoveries, and
excitement within our exploration of programming and our personal projects.

# reasoning

as enthusiasts, we love talking about our own, and hearing other people's
experiences with programming.

# the lowercase, tilde.town, and our values

inconsistent lowercase is great because it's easier to type in the terminal,
and it's more accessible to people whose main focus isn't english punctuation
and grammar. by removing the requirement to type in perfect punctuation and
grammar, we take away any elitism associated with it. this; however, doesn't
mean you have to type in lowercase.

lowercase is also the unwritten spirit of [tilde.town](https://tilde.town/),
where we all met.

tilde.town is built around kindness, respect, intentional community, and
inclusiveness. these are values we wish to see not only in our community, but
also on the internet as a whole.
