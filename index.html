        <h1>us</h1>
        <p> we are a friendly programming-enthusiast community that wants to
        share our discoveries, experiences, and ideas in a community-created
        zine.</p>

        <h1>goals</h1>
        <p>we hope to create a zine that discusses our journeys, discoveries,
        and excitement within our exploration of programming and our personal
        projects.</p>

        <h1>reasoning</h1>
        <p>as enthusiasts, we love talking about our own, and hearing other
        people's experiences with programming.</p>

        <h1>the lowercase, tilde.town, and our values</h1>
        <p> inconsistent lowercase is great because it's easier to type in the
        terminal, and it's more accessible to people whose main focus isn't
        english punctuation and grammar. by removing the requirement to type in
        perfect punctuation and grammar, we take away any elitism associated
        with it. this; however, doesn't mean you have to type in lowercase.</p>

        <p>lowercase is also the unwritten spirit of
        <a href="https://tilde.town/">tilde.town</a>, where we all met.</p>

        <p>tilde.town is built around kindness, respect, intentional community,
        and inclusiveness. these are values we wish to see not only in our
        community, but also on the internet as a whole.</p>
